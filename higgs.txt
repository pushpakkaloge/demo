The Higgs boson, sometimes called the Higgs 
particle,[9][10] is an elementary particle in 
the Standard Model of particle physics produced
 by the quantum excitation of the Higgs field,
 [11][12] one of the fields in particle physics
  theory.[12] In the Standard Model, the Higgs
   particle is a massive scalar boson with 
   zero spin, even (positive) parity, no 
   electric charge, and no colour charge 
   that couples to (interacts with) mass.[13]
    It is also very unstable, decaying into
     other particles almost immediately upon 
     generation.

The Higgs field is a scalar field with two 
neutral and two electrically charged components
 that form a complex doublet of the weak 
 isospin SU(2) symmetry. Its "Mexican 
 hat-shaped" potential leads it to take a n
 onzero value everywhere (including otherwise
  empty space), which breaks the weak isospin 
  symmetry of the electroweak interaction and,
   via the Higgs mechanism, gives mass to many 
   particles.
